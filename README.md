# üõ°Ô∏è OpenCanary Honeypot Activity Report

**Analyst:** Andrew  
**Date:** 2025-06-12  
**System:** Kali Linux (Localhost Simulation)  
**Project Type:** Honeypot Deployment & Log Analysis

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Summary

- Installed and configured **OpenCanary** honeypot on Kali Linux
- Enabled services: **FTP, SSH, HTTP**
- Configured logging to `/var/tmp/opencanary.log` using `logging.FileHandler`
- Simulated multiple login attempts to trigger honeypot responses
- Captured and analyzed log entries in real-time

---

## üì∏ Screenshots

### 1. Logger Configuration (`opencanary.conf`)
This configuration confirms logs are directed to a local file, validating the honeypot‚Äôs ability to store and organize activity:

### 2. Captured Honeypot Logs (`/var/tmp/opencanary.log`)
Captured authentication attempts from the local IP (`172.19.109.142`) with various credentials:

## üîç Analysis

- Events were generated by manually simulating FTP login attempts from the host
- Honeypot correctly identified service type, source IP, credentials, and timestamps
- Validated logging pipeline from `opencanary.conf` to `/var/tmp/opencanary.log`
- Provides a baseline for future external traffic detection

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

- Move honeypot to a segmented or external-facing lab network
- Simulate or monitor for real external traffic (e.g., bots, port scans)
- Enrich IP addresses with geolocation and threat intelligence tools
- Forward logs to a SIEM for deeper analysis (e.g., Splunk, Wazuh)
- Deploy Cowrie for high-interaction SSH deception
